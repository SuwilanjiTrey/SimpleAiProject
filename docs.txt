what we need to implement from this is the following:
AI.PY:
    -this module contains the AI implementation and how it should actually solve the rubiks cube.
        ;implementation: -breadth first search will be used to find the shortest route to solve this
                         -depth first search can also be used but not   
    -this also contains functions like the mind function that shold facilitate the in process communication with 
     itself to determine if should proceed to solving the next pattern or not
    -this module should also rotate the cube while solving it   
        ;rotation function: this function works by rotating the cube when the ai is looking for a specific cubelet
                            once the cubelet is found, the AI should get back to the original face it was working with 
                            until it meets/finds the pattern defined

3x3.py:
